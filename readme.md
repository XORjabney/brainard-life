# Conway's Game of Life

I created this simple interactive life implementation for the 2017 Day of Code at Dora L. Small school in South Portland, ME.

## Instructions

* Clear the board and leave it paused.
* Students gather around the monitor and you explain the 3 rules.
* Each rule is demonstrated by creating a simple pattern with the mouse and advancing the simulation one set. Students predict the outcome before advancing.
* The "sprinkle life" button is used to scatter life randomly around the board. Students make predictions about how many will survive.
* Keep sprinkling life until the students vote to stop.
* Run the simulation full speed and watch it animate. Ask if the outcome matches their predictions.
* Students design their own patterns using the worksheets and predict the outcomes.
* Students use the computer in small groups testing the patterns they created, and experimenting with the example patterns. Motivated students should be able to create a working "glider gun".

## Code

The activity is written in simple HTML and JavaScript, advanced students might like to try changing the color of the dots, or altering the rules. How does it change if some of them are disabled?
