# Conway's Game of Life

I created this simple interactive life implementation for the 2017 Day of Code at Dora L. Small school in South Portland, ME.

The activity generally went as follows:

* Clear the board and leave it paused.
* Students gather around the monitor and you explain the 3 rules.
* Each rule is demonstrated by creating a simple pattern with the mouse and advancing the simulation one set. Students predict the outcome before advancing.
* The "sprinkle life" button is used to scatter life randomly around the board. Students make predictions about how many will survive.
* Keep sprinkling life until the students vote to stop.
* Run the simulation full speed and watch it animate. Ask if the outcome matches their predictions.
* Students design their own patterns using the worksheets and predict the outcomes.
* Students use the computer in small groups testing the patterns they created, and experimenting with the example patterns. Motivated students should be able to create a working "glider gun".
